# Project Title: Text summarization from basic to advanced approaches.

#### Group name: Oasis

#### Team members: Nattapat Juthaprachakul (njuthapr); Siyu Wu (swa246)

## Abstract:
We are going to implement Text summarization based on different algorithms and compare their performances on the same evaluation metrics. The techniques we are going to implement include basic approaches such as a count-based model and advanced approaches like Deeplearning. The main metric for model evaluation is ROUGE score (R-1, R-2, and R-L). Also, we will try both extractive and abstractive techniques.

## Project scope:
Only English texts will be used in this project.

## Datasets:
These are the datasets we will use in our project:
1. CNN and Daily Mail news dataset, which can be downloaded online (https://cs.nyu.edu/~kcho/DMQA/)
2. DUC 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 dataset, which can be obtained by emailing NIST (https://www-nlpir.nist.gov/projects/duc/guidelines/2002.html)

## Additional datasets:
3. X-Sum is the dataset for abstractive models, which can be downloaded online (https://github.com/EdinburghNLP/XSum/tree/master/XSum-Dataset)
4. Gigaword is a sentence summarization/headline generation task with short input documents, which can be downloaded online (https://github.com/eecrazy/ConstructingNEEG_IJCAI_2018, https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/gigaword)
